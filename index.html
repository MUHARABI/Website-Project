                    <p>
                        Since I was five years old and watched the world cup in 2010 on the television with my family, 
                        I developed a huge passion for the sport of soccer. Whether its playing for fun, 
                        or competetivly or even just watching soccer, I get the same enthusiastic passionate enjoyment. 
                        Soccer has and will continue to be a great passion and part of my identity

                    <h3>Video Games</h3>
                    <p>
                        There is nothing better than relaxing and playing video games after a long day. 
                        My first exposure to video games was when I was 4 and played Wii sports and Mario kart on my wii. 
                        I then began playing higher level strategy games with high skill requirements such as Call of duty and Rocket league. 
                        Video games for me has been a great distraction and way of challenging the brain 
                        in different unique ways through hand eye coordination. 
                        My passion for videogames inspired me to get into computer science and 
                        potentially get into a career of game design

                    <h3>Travel</h3>
                    <p>
                        I have been lucky enough to have had the opportunity to travel to 4 different continents and 10 different countries.
                        these countries are Canada, Ireland, United Kingdom, Switzerland, Turkiye, Jordon, Qatar, UAE, Egypt and most importantly my country of Sudan. 
                        I love the expierence of going to different airports and places with different cultures, languages, and lifestyles around the world.
