                <h3>Soccer</h3>
                <p>
                    Since I was five years old and watched the World Cup in 2010 on the television with my family, 
                    I developed a huge passion for the sport of soccer. Whether playing for fun, 
                    or competitively or even just watching soccer, I get the same enthusiastic passionate enjoyment. 
                    I played competitively for club in middle school and had the opportunity to play for my high school. 
                    Soccer has and will continue to be a great passion and part of my identity.

                <h3>Video Games</h3>
                <p>
                    There's nothing quite like unwinding with video games after a long day. 
                    My journey with gaming began at age 4 with Wii Sports and Mario Kart on the Wii. 
                    As I grew older, I moved on to more complex strategy games like Call of Duty and Rocket League, 
                    which tested my skills and hand-eye coordination in new ways. This passion for video games not only 
                    provides a unique mental challenge but also inspired me to pursue computer science and explore a potential 
                    career in game design.

                <h3>Travel</h3>
                <p>
                    I've been fortunate to travel across four continents and explore ten incredible countries: 
                    Canada, Ireland, the United Kingdom, Switzerland, Turkiye, Jordan, Qatar, UAE, Egypt, 
                    and my beloved home country, Sudan. I relish the adventure of discovering new airports, cultures, 
                    languages, and lifestyles around the globe.
